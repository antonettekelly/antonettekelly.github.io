About Me
======
Naturally curious and passionate about transforming complex data into actionable insights, I thrive on new challenges and constantly seek opportunities to expand my skills and knowledge.

My primary areas of focus include data analysis, predictive modeling, prototyping, and the creation of visualization dashboards. Beyond my technical pursuits, I find great joy in sharing my knowledge with colleagues, especially in the area of data. I am also eager to explore and learn about other fields to broaden my expertise.

Previously, I honed my skills in the financial services industry, focusing on analyzing various financial products within a smart mobile application. During my academic journey, I also worked as a laboratory assistant in probability and statistics, where I assisted students in conducting experiments and understanding statistical concepts. With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and information Systems, I am committed to leveraging data-driven insights to drive business growth and innovation.
